# FakerDATA_Riyadh_Expo_2030

## Have you ever wondered about the strategic dashboard that will illuminate the horizons of Riyadh Expo 2030?

Here, I have successfully generated hypothetical data using the Faker library with Python and visualized it using Tableau. This approach could give us an initial glimpse into various aspects of this global event, including interactions and potential opportunities.

Riyadh Expo 2030 represents a major milestone in highlighting Saudi Arabia's status as a global tourist destination, aligned with the ambitious Saudi Vision 2030 which aims to diversify economic sources and enhance tourist attractions. It opens new horizons for culture and innovation, shining a light on the rich heritage and modern advancements of the Kingdom.

In this project, I designed the dashboard in Tableau to highlight the possibilities that data analysis related to this event can offer. Although the data is generated, the dashboard demonstrates the capabilities of analytics in embracing the synergy of global innovation and participation.
